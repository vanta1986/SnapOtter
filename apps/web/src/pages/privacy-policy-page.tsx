            <p>
              SnapOtter is a self-hosted, open-source image processing application. Your instance is
              operated and controlled entirely by whoever deployed it. This policy describes how the
              software itself handles your data.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Local Processing</h2>
            <p>
              All image processing happens entirely on the server where SnapOtter is deployed. Your
              images are never sent to external services or third-party APIs. When you upload an
              image for processing, it is handled in memory or in temporary storage on the host
              machine and is not retained after the operation completes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Product Analytics</h2>
            <p>
              SnapOtter includes optional, anonymous product analytics. When you choose to
              participate, the following is collected:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Which tools you use (e.g., "crop tool used")</li>
              <li>Error reports without file data</li>
              <li>App version and performance metrics</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2 font-medium">What is never collected:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Your images, PDFs, and files</li>
              <li>File names and contents</li>
              <li>Any personal information or IP addresses</li>
            </ul>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Your Choice</h2>
            <p>
              Each user is asked individually on first login whether to participate. You can change
              your choice anytime in Settings. Server administrators can disable analytics entirely
              by setting{" "}
              <code className="text-xs bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 rounded">ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false</code>.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Data Storage</h2>
            <p>
              If authentication is enabled, the application stores user accounts (usernames and
              hashed passwords) in a local SQLite database on the host machine. If you use the Files
              feature, uploaded files are stored on the server's filesystem. All stored data remains
              entirely under the control of the instance operator.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              All image processing happens locally — your images are never sent anywhere. If you opt
              in to product analytics, anonymous usage data is sent to PostHog and Sentry as
              described above. AI-powered features run locally using bundled models. No other
              external services are contacted.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Open Source</h2>
            <p>
              SnapOtter is fully open source. You can audit the source code to verify these claims
              at any time. Transparency is a core principle of this project.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-2">Your Control</h2>
            <p>
              Because SnapOtter is self-hosted, the instance operator has full control over all
              data. You can delete your data at any time by removing files from the server or
              deleting the database. No data exists outside of your infrastructure.
